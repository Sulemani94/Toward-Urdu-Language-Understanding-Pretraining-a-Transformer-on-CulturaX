# Toward-Urdu-Language-Understanding-Pretraining-a-Transformer-on-CulturaX
This work aims to develop a transformer-based Urdu language model using the CulturaX dataset to address the lack of Urdu-specific NLP resources. By training from scratch with a custom tokenizer, it enables Urdu text generation and understanding, supporting low-resource language inclusion in AI.

# Toward-Urdu-Language-Understanding-Pretraining-a-Transformer-on-CulturaX
This work aims to develop a transformer-based Urdu language model using the CulturaX dataset to address the lack of Urdu-specific NLP resources. By training from scratch with a custom tokenizer, it enables Urdu text generation and understanding, supporting low-resource language inclusion in AI.
### Features
- Address the lack of high-quality Urdu-specific models by training a transformer-based model using publicly available multilingual web-crawled data.

- Enable downstream NLP tasks such as Urdu text generation, question answering, and dialogue systems by providing a pretrained LLM foundation.

- Demonstrate the feasibility of training effective LLMs for low-resource languages using accessible infrastructure (e.g., Google Colab with GPU), open-source libraries (Hugging Face), and a clean custom tokenizer.

- Contribute to linguistic inclusivity and digital empowerment for Urdu-speaking communities by lowering the barrier to building NLP applications in their native language.
